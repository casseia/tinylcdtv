# tinylcdtv
I have a tiny screen and I plan to turn it into a tiny TV

Basically I have a tiny LCD that I got from Waveshare and plan to turn it into a little TV with my Raspberry Pi 3a+ if the slowness doesn't make me too impatient. This is where I'll put my code for the stuff I build with it. I followed the Raspberry Pi Python tutorial on their site (https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.69inch_LCD_Module#Run_Python_Demo), and am kinda building from there.
